### Hi I'm Jim ðŸ‘‹

I'm focused on helping Developers bridge what they've learned into the experience needed to land their first job or move up to a better position.

We live in an age where learning resouces including articles, tutorials, ebooks, courses, & videos are abundant on the Internet. In addition,
they are free or low cost. These two factors have made it easy for new Developers to enter the profession and for experienced Developers to 
advance their career.

Despite this what's still needed is a way for Developers to turn what they've learned into experience and expertise. The same experience and expertise
that will make them stand above other job candidates.

This is what I'm focused on at Chingu, Inc.
